This is a responsive shoe store app.  
You can watch demo version here: https://crunchyboots.herokuapp.com/

It is based on the following:  

-TypeScript  
-React  
-Redux  
-SCSS  
  
Third-party Services:  
  
react-burger-menu  
slick-carousel  
react-reveal  
react-scroll-up  
react-scroll-to-top  
react-spinners  
react-icons  
react-phone-number-input  

*-App has been migrating to TypeScript.  
As result some third-party services could work unproperly. 
But it will be fixed pretty soon.     

Besides I used json-server, BEM-methodology, Redux-Thunk.  
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]  
(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
  
To run project:  
  
npm install  
npm run json-server  
npm start
